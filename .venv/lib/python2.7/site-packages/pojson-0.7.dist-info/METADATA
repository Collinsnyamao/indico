pojson
******

pojson is a tool that allows you to create JSON data files from PO
files. These files are designed to be used with Obviel_'s `i18n support`_.

.. _Obviel: http://obviel.org/

.. _`i18n support`: http://www.obviel.org/en/latest/i18n.html

The `Javascript Gettext`_ already provides a Perl-based tool (po2json)
that is very similar, so this can be seen as a rewrite to Python. One
difference is that pojson does not output domain information in the
resulting datastructure - it is one level less deep. The domain
information must instead be supplied when the file is loaded.

Basic use to generate a JSON file::

  $ pojson <path/to/po> 

Pretty-print output::

  $ pojson -p <path/to/po> 

Help::

  $ pojson --help

Normally you would send the output to a file, such as::

  $ pojson something.po > something.json

Normally pojson will try to guess the encoding of the .po file, but
you can also explicitly supply an encoding::

  $ pojson -e utf-8 something.po > something.json

CHANGES
*******

0.7 (2016-06-30)
================

- Python 3 support.

0.6 (2014-03-06)
================

- A new po2json_babel command that lets you create a babel compatible
  catalog structure. Thanks to Swen Mun (@longfin) for this feature.

- A bugfix concerning encoding handling in po2json.

0.5 (2014-02-27)
================

- Support for the context feature in Javascript gettext. See
  http://jsgettext.berlios.de/doc/html/Gettext.html#pgettext__msgctxt__msgid__
  Thanks to Swen Mun (@longfin) for this feature.

- Added distutils command class ``po2json`` to compile catalogs for
  use in ``setup.py``.  Thanks to Swen Mun (@longfin) for this feature.

0.4 (2012-06-20)
================

- Totally break the command line interface to simplify options. We
  only want to generate those JSON files that Obviel i18n likes. Works
  with Obviel 1.0b2 and later.

0.3 (2011-06-02)
================

- Actually got the output wrong so jsgettext couldn't work with it. Fixed.

- Some sanity checking that the input file has the .po extension, as
  evidently polib accepts *any* file and still gives output...

0.2 (2011-06-02)
================

- Error when referring to non-existent po file

0.1 (2011-05-04)
================

- Initial release.
